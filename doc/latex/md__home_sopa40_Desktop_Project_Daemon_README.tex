A simple daemon project that monitors the system information and logs some information.

Current setup requires launching the daemon with a command line for simple demonstration. Console app will configure all required parameters and launch the daemon. Daemon logs can be found in syslog\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Ubuntu\+: {\ttfamily \$tail -\/f /var/log/syslog} ~\newline

\item Majnaro\+: {\ttfamily \$journalctl -\/a \+\_\+\+P\+ID=id}, where id of process can be obtained with {\ttfamily \$pidof simple\+\_\+daemon}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

About the daemon\+: The simple\+\_\+daemon is a daemon that can log some system information into files and syslog. To launch simple\+\_\+daemon clone the project and just use {\ttfamily make} in source folder. In .build folder you can find build artefacts and target file. Copy of the target file you can find in source folder as well. Just launch it with {\ttfamily \$ ./simple\+\_\+daemon}

With additional options you can configure types of logs, its frequency and verbosity. Just run {\ttfamily \$ ./simple\+\_\+daemon -\/-\/help} or {\ttfamily \$ ./simple\+\_\+daemon -\/-\/usage} to read more about options.
